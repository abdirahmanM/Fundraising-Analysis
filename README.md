# Fundraising-Analysis
## Overview of Project
I made an interactive dashboard to see what the funds in a fundraising campaign were
### Purpose
see what the funds are and how it works
## Analysis and Challenges
In this project I used shapes and pivot tables to determine outcome

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
[outcome by launch date](resource/outcomes_id.png)
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
[outcome by goals](resource/outcomes_goal.png)
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
It was hard getting the correct pivot table set right
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
