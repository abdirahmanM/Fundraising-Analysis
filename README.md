# Fundraising-Analysis
## Overview of Project
I made an interactive dashboard to see what the funds in a fundraising campaign were
### Purpose
see what the funds are and how it works
## Analysis and Challenges
In this project I used shapes and pivot tables to determine outcome

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
![outcome by launch date](resource/outcomes_ID.png)
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
![outcome by goals](resource/outcomes_goal.png)
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
It was hard getting the correct pivot table set right
## Results
The results of this project was a dashboard that contained information that used to see funds raised by a fundraising campaign and even though it was hard to create it in the beginging I now know how to do it and I can make a better one in the future.
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
